		<section name="What is MyBatis?">
			<p>
				MyBatis is a first class persistence framework with support for
				custom SQL,
				stored procedures and advanced mappings. MyBatis
				eliminates almost
				all of the JDBC code and manual setting of
				parameters and retrieval
				of results. MyBatis can use simple XML or
				Annotations for
				configuration and map primitives, Map interfaces and
				Java POJOs
				(Plain Old Java Objects) to database records.
