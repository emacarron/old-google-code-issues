#summary Migration Steps when Switching from iBATIS to MyBatis

== Introduction ==

MyBatis is a direct fork of the iBATIS code.  At the time of this writing, there are no known plans to continue the
iBATIS project within the Apache software foundation, and thus it is somewhat less of a for, and more like just a
bend in the road.  As with a corner when driving, there is a slight adjustment to be made.

== Steps ==

There are only a few simple steps to follow.

  * Sign up for new mailing lists
  * Use the new issue tracker and wiki
  * Download new build
  * Change DTD/Doctype in XML Headers
  * Change bookmarks / links to our site

=== Mailing Lists ===

First, unsubscribe from the old mailing lists by sending an email to each one that you are signed up for.

Most users of the Java framework will only be signed up for the user list.

  * [mailto:user-java-unsubscribe@ibatis.apache.org] - Java User List
  * [mailto:dev-unsubscribe@ibatis.apache.org] - Developer List
  * [mailto:commits-unsubscribe@ibatis.apache.org] - Commits List

There are no replacements for the developer or commits lists.  Commits are easy to find with subversion or on the
[http://code.google.com/p/mybatis/source/list Source/Changes] tab of the Google Projects page

Now you're ready to sign up to the new MyBatis Google Group.  If you already have a Google Account, you won't
have much to do...

  * Log into Google (GMail, YouTube, etc.) or sign up if you don't have an account.
  * Then go to the group: [http://groups.google.com/group/mybatis-user]
  * Click join.

You can leave and re-join the group any time using the same page.  You can also search the group right there on the discussion
page.
