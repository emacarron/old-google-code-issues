#summary Migration Steps when Switching from iBATIS to MyBatis

== Introduction ==

MyBatis is a direct fork of the iBATIS code.  At the time of this writing, there are no known plans to continue the
iBATIS project within the Apache software foundation, and thus it is somewhat less of a for, and more like just a
bend in the road.  As with a corner when driving, there is a slight adjustment to be made.

== Steps ==

There are only a few simple steps to follow.
