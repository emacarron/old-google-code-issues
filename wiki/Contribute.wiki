#summary Description of how members of the community can contribute to the project.

= Get Involved =

There are many ways to get involved.

  * Be active and helpful on the mailing lists

  * Find bugs
      * Submit issues with failing unit tests
      * Submit patches that make the tests pass

  * Create a new feature or modification
      * Discuss your changes on the user mailing list to get feedback from the community
      * Submit new feature to the issue tracking system with passing tests
      * Attach the patch file (or even just the complete files if that works... we can diff easily enough)

  * Write documentation
      * Submit documentation contributions or changes directly in the body of the issue (which supports wiki markup).  We'll add it to the official guide.

The issue tracking system is here:

[http://code.google.com/p/mybatis/issues/list]

The instructions for checking out the source are here:

After a few good contributions, we'll often provide commit access directly to the repository.
