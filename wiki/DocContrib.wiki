#summary How to contribute documentation to MyBatis

= Help out! =

You make the best author of the documentation, because you are a user of the framework and therefore have a better perspective for what it takes to explain and use !MyBatis.

There are a few ways you can contribute to the documentation:

  * Checkout the Wiki from [http://code.google.com/p/mybatis/source/checkout SVN] and create a page that you can submit as an [http://code.google.com/p/mybatis/issues/list Issue] with a patch.

  * Submit an issue with the description containing the newly created documents that you'd like to contribute (Issue Tracker supports wiki formatting).

  * Make a request to the user list regarding documentation that is missing.
