== Introduction ==

This page will guide the development team with setting up their environment to perform a release.


== Prerequisites  ==

 * Install/Configure PGP - The artifacts that are deployed to the central maven repositories need to be signed.  There is a very good [http://www.sonatype.com/people/2010/01/how-to-generate-pgp-signatures-with-maven/ guide] that will walk you though this.

 * Install Maven 2.2.1 or higher.  2.2.0 has a bug that will produce invalid checksums.

== Configuration ==
=== Maven ===
As of Maven 2.1.0 you can now encrypt your servers passwords.  We highly recommend that you follow this [http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html guide] to set your master password and use it to encrypt your Sonatype password in the next section.
=== Sonatype ===
Using the instructions from the previous step encrypt your Sonatype password and add the following servers to your ~/.m2/settings.xml file.  You may already have other servers in this file.  If not just create the file.
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>
      <username>nmaves</username>
      <password>{jSMOWnoPFgsHVpMvz5VrIt5kRbzGpI8u+9EF1iFQyJQ=}</password>
    </server>
    <server>
      <id>sonatype-nexus-staging</id>
      <username>nmaves</username>
      <password>{jSMOWnoPFgsHVpMvz5VrIt5kRbzGpI8u+9EF1iFQyJQ=}</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
}}}

== Release ==
The release plugin for maven is already configured in the MyBatis pom file so all you need to do is execute the following two steps to complete the release.  The first step will create the release tag and update the pom with the correct release and snapshot versions.  The second step will sign and deploy the artifacts to the Sonatype open source repository.  This repository is synced every hour to the central Maven repositories.  If you don't supply the optional gpg.passphrase then you will be prompted for it.

 # Prepare the release
{{{ mvn release:prepare }}}
 # Perform
{{{ mvn release:perform -Dgpg.passphrase=thephrase}}}
