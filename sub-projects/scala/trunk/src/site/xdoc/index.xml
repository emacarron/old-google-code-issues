        MyBatis is a persistence framework for Java, so you can use it in Scala as any other
        java library, nonetheless the main API is too java centric, it uses Java annotations
        and external xml files where you put your SQL.
            </p>
            <p>
        The MyBatis Scala API is a lightweight wrapper, it  supports a 100% of the framework
        functionality, taking advantage of the elegant Scala syntax and its type system.
        With this API you can use the Scala collections and "Scala beans", and you can define
        all you dynamic SQL code directly in your scala code without String concatenation
        and with very clear syntax.
            </p>
            <p>
        Appart from the main configuration xml file where you define the datasource and transaction
        configurations, you will avoid use of external xml files and java Annotations.
            </p>
