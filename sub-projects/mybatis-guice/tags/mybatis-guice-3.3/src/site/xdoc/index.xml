    <section name="Why MyBatis-Guice - Motivation">
      <p>In our daily work we've been strongly using both
      <a href="http://www.mybatis.org/">MyBatis Sql Mapper</a> and
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/">Google Guice</a>
      frameworks and once noticed we'd been continuosly repeating the same
      code snippets in different projects, according to the DRY
      <i>don't repeat yourself</i> principle, we started
      realizing something that alleviate us the task to create our stuff.</p>
      <p>Indeed, this small library intends to create the missing perfect glue
      between the two popular frameworks, reducing the boilerplate and
      redundant code that users have to write to configure and use MyBatis
      into a Google Guice context.</p>

      <subsection name="A little bit of history">
        <p>
            The mybatis-guice library was born during the Christmas' vacation in
            the far December 2009, with the name of <a href="http://www.99soft.org/projects/ibaguice/1.0">iBaGuice</a>
            on Google Code, created and maintained by the <a href="http://www.99soft.org/">99soft.org</a>
            folks Marco Speranza and Simone Tripodi.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the two communities where strictly collaborating, Clinton Begin,
            the creator of the MyBatis project, invited Simone Tripodi to join the
            MyBatis team, bringing with him the <i>iBaGuice</i>
            code base to become an official MyBatis subproject.
        </p>
        <p>
            By that day, the mybatis-guice project is maintained by the MyBatis.org
            team.
        </p>

    <section name="Requirements">
      <p> Before starting reading the manual, it is very important you're familiar with both MyBatis and Google Guice
  framework and therminology. </p>
  <p> Like MyBatis and Google Guice, mybatis-guice requires Java 5 or higher. </p>
    </section>

    <section name="Acknowledgements">
      <p>
            A special thanks goes to all the special people who made the Google Guice
            integration a reality, above all Clinton Begin, who strongly believed
            on that MyBatis sub-project, and Marco Speranza, without him that
            project wouldn't exist.
        </p>
        <p>
            Special acknowledgments go to Stephen Friedrich for providing an amazing patch,
            Poitras Christian who made the XML module a reality and Marzia Forli for the JRS330 feedbacks.
