    <title>Getting a SqlSession</title>
      <para>
        In MyBatis you use the <literal>SqlSessionFactory</literal> to create an
        <literal>SqlSession</literal>. Once you have a session, you use it to
        execute your mapped statements, get mappers,  commit or rollback connections and
        finally, when it is no longer needed, you close the session. With
        MyBatis-Guice you don't need to use <literal>SqlSessionFactory</literal>
        directly because your beans can be injected with a thread safe
        <literal>SqlSession</literal> that automatically commits, rollbacks and
        closes the session based on @Transactional annotation.

        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class UserDaoImpl implements UserDao {

    @Inject private SqlSession sqlSession;

    public User getUser(String userId) {
        return (User) this.sqlSession.selectOne("org.mybatis.guice.sample.mapper.UserMapper.getUser", userId);
    }

}]]></programlisting>
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Getting Mappers</title>
        <para>
          Rather than code data access objects (DAOs) manually using
          <literal>SqlSession</literal>, Mybatis-Guice is able to inject
          data mapper interfaces directly into your service beans. When using mappers
          you simply call them as you have always called your DAOs, but you won't
          need to code any DAO implementation because MyBatis-Guice will create a
          proxy for you. When using mappers you will not even see the inner
          <literal>SqlSession</literal>, but not worries, it will just work.

    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[@Singleton
public class FooServiceMapperImpl implements FooService {

    @Inject
    private UserMapper userMapper;

    @Transactional
    public User doSomeBusinessStuff(String userId) {
        return this.userMapper.getUser(userId);
    }

}]]></programlisting>
