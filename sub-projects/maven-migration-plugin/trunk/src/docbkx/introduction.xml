        <title>Why a Maven Plugin - Motivation</title>
        <para>
             Increasingly into our projects, we use <emphasis>Apache Maven</emphasis>, 
             <emphasis>MyBatis</emphasis> framework and <emphasis>myBatis migration tool</emphasis>
             to maintain our database structure. 
             So in order to have a fully integrated tool we started to implement a solution that 
             integrates <emphasis> mybatis migration tool </emphasis> into a standard <emphasis>Apache Maven</emphasis>
            build life cycle.
        </para>
        <para>
            The aim of <emphasis>mybatis maven-migration-plugin</emphasis> is to perform a complete porting of all
             <emphasis>mybatis migration tool</emphasis> commands to standard maven plugin.
        </para>

    <section id="introduction.story">
        <title>A little bit of history</title>
        <para>
            The mybatys maven-migration-plugin was born in April 2010 after a skype conference with Marco Speranza and 
            Simone Tripodi where we was looking for a solution to integrate mybatis migration tool to our softrware build life cycle.
            The project was created and maintained by the <ulink url="http://www.99soft.org/">99soft.org</ulink> and posted
            on Google code with the name maven-migrate-plugin<ulink url="http://www.99soft.org/projects/maven-migration-plugin/1.0/">
            maven-migrate-plugin</ulink>.
        </para>
        <para>
            In September 2010 Simone Tripodi and Clinton Begin has accepted Marco Speranza to join into MyBatis community
            and bringing with him the <emphasis>maven-migration-plugin</emphasis>
            code base to become an official MyBatis subproject.
        </para>
        <para>
            By that day, the MyBatis Migration Maven Plugin project is maintained by the MyBatis.org team.
        </para>

        <title>Requirements</title>
        <para>
            Before starting reading the manual, it is very important you're
            familiar with both MyBatis Migration Tool and Apache Maven and therminology,
            otherwise it would be very difficult to understand the described context.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section id="introduction.acks">
        <title>Acknowledgements</title>
        <para>
            A special thanks goes to all the special people who made the Maven Migration Plugin
            a reality, above all Clinton Begin, who's strongly supporting the subprojects proliferation.
