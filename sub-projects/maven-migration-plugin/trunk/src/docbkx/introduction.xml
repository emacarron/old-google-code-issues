            <emphasis>MyBatis</emphasis> framework and <emphasis>MyBatis Migration tool</emphasis> to maintain the
            database structure, in order to have a fully integrated tool we started implementing a solution that
            mixes the <emphasis>MyBatis Migration tool</emphasis> power into a standard <emphasis>Apache Maven</emphasis>

            The <emphasis>MyBatis maven-migration-plugin</emphasis> aims to perform a complete porting of all

        <title>A little bit of history</title>
        <para>
            The MyBatis maven-migration-plugin was born in April 2010 after a Skype conference between Marco Speranza
            and Simone Tripodi where both were looking for a solution to integrate MyBatis Migration tool into the
            softrware build life cycle.
            The project was created and maintained by <ulink url="http://www.99soft.org/">99soft.org</ulink> and posted
            on Google Code with the name <ulink url="http://www.99soft.org/projects/maven-migration-plugin/1.1/">maven-migrate-plugin</ulink>.
        </para>
        <para>
            In September 2010 Simone proposed Marco as new MyBatis community member, Clinton Begin and the team accepted
            letting him bringing the <emphasis>maven-migration-plugin</emphasis> code base to become an official
            MyBatis subproject.
        </para>
        <para>
            By that day, the MyBatis Migration Maven Plugin project is maintained by the MyBatis.org team.

        <title>Requirements</title>
        <para>
            Before starting reading the manual, it is very important you're
            familiar with both MyBatis Migration Tool and Apache Maven and therminology,
            otherwise it would be very difficult to understand the described context.
        </para>

    <section id="introduction.acks">
        <title>Acknowledgements</title>
        <para>
            A special thanks goes to all the special people who made the Maven Migration Plugin
            a reality, above all Clinton Begin, who's strongly supporting the subprojects proliferation.
